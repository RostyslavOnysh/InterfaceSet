# Explanation of how the code works:

Create a new HashSet called uniqueSet and initialize it with the elements from set1. This set will be used to store the unique elements from both sets.
```java
Set<T> uniqueSet = new HashSet<>(set1);
```

Add all the elements from set2 to uniqueSet. This ensures that uniqueSet contains all the elements from both sets.
```java
uniqueSet.addAll(set2);
```
Create a new HashSet called intersection and initialize it with the elements from set1. This set will be used to store the common elements between the two sets.
```java~~~~
Set<T> intersection = new HashSet<>(set1);
```
Use the retainAll method on intersection to keep only the elements that are also present in set2. After this operation, intersection will contain only the common elements between set1 and set2.
```java
intersection.retainAll(set2);
```
Remove the elements present in intersection from uniqueSet. This operation eliminates the common elements, leaving only the unique elements from both sets.
```java

uniqueSet.removeAll(intersection);
```
Finally, the uniqueSet contains the symmetric difference between set1 and set2, which consists of the elements that are present in either set1 or set2, but not both. Return uniqueSet.
```java
return uniqueSet;
```
The code you provided as a comment block is an alternative implementation of the symmetricDifference method. It follows a similar logic but uses different variable names. Here's a breakdown of that code:

Create two new HashSet objects called firstSet and secondSet, and initialize them with the elements from set1 and set2, respectively.
```java
Set<T> firstSet = new HashSet<>(set1);
Set<T> secondSet = new HashSet<>(set2);
```
Remove the elements present in set2 from firstSet. This operation eliminates the elements that are common between the two sets from firstSet.
```java
firstSet.removeAll(set2);
```
Remove the elements present in set1 from secondSet. This operation eliminates the elements that are common between the two sets from secondSet.
```java
secondSet.removeAll(set1);
```
Add all the elements from secondSet to firstSet. This combines the remaining unique elements from both sets into firstSet.
```java
firstSet.addAll(secondSet);
```
Finally, firstSet contains the symmetric difference between set1 and set2, which is returned as the result.
```java
return firstSet;
```
